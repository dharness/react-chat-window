No operation as a moduleâ„¢. The long awaited successor to [`noop`][noop1]. Noop2
does even less than its predecessor, and is 100% tested to guarantee nothing
happens.

## Installation
```bash
npm install noop2
```

## Usage
```js
var noop = require('noop2');

noop();
// nothing happened
```

## Why?
This is both a joke and actually useful. Obviously we _might_ be taking npm
a bit too far by bundling this as a module, but when running tests it's
sometimes nice to be able to import an empty function if only to keep style
consistent. So here you have it.
