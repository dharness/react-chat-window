nwb is a toolkit for:

- [Quick Development with React, Inferno, Preact or vanilla JavaScript](#quick-development)
- Developing:
  - [React Apps](#react-apps)
  - [Preact Apps](#preact-apps)
  - [Inferno Apps](#inferno-apps)
  - [Vanilla JavaScript Apps](#vanilla-javascript-apps)
  - [React Components and Libraries](#react-components-and-libraries)
  - [npm Modules for the Web](#npm-modules-for-the-web)

A zero-config development setup is provided, but nwb also supports [configuration](/docs/Configuration.md#configuration) and [plugin modules](/docs/Plugins.md#plugins) which add extra functionality (e.g. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) support), should you need them

## Install

Installing globally provides an `nwb` command for quick development and working with projects.

```sh
npm install -g nwb
```

> Using **npm >= 3 is recommended**, as Babel 6 takes significantly more time and disk space to install with npm 2 due to its lack of deduplication.

To use nwb's tooling in a project, install it as a `devDependency` and use `nwb` commands in `package.json` `"scripts"`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev nwb
```
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nwb serve-react-app",
    "build": "nwb build-react-app"
  }
}
```

## Quick Development

For quick development with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) or vanilla JavaScript, use the `nwb react`, `nwb inferno`, `nwb preact` or `nwb web`commands.

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  }
}
```
```sh
$ nwb react run app.js
✔ Installing react and react-dom

The app is running at http://localhost:3000/
```
```sh
$ nwb react build app.js
✔ Building React app

**See [Quick Development with nwb](/docs/guides/QuickDevelopment.md#quick-development-with-nwb) for a more detailed guide.**

## React Apps

Use `nwb new react-app` to create a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) app skeleton, preconfigured with npm scripts which use `nwb` for development:

```sh
nwb new react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), start editing the code and changes will be hot-reloaded into the running app.

`npm test` will run the app's tests and `npm run build` will create a production build.

**See [Developing React Apps with nwb](/docs/guides/ReactApps.md#developing-react-apps-with-nwb) for a more detailed guide.**

## Preact Apps

Use `nwb new preact-app` to create a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) app skeleton:

```sh
nwb new preact-app my-app
```

## Inferno Apps

Use `nwb new inferno-app` to create an [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/) app skeleton:

```sh
nwb new inferno-app my-app
```

## Vanilla JavaScript Apps

Use `nwb new web-app` to create a vanilla JavaScript app skeleton:

```sh
nwb new web-app my-app
```

## React Components and Libraries

```sh
nwb new react-component my-component

cd my-component/
```

`npm start` will run a demo app you can use to develop your component or library against.

`npm test` will run the project's tests and `npm run build` will create ES5, ES6 modules and UMD builds for publishing to npm.

**See [Developing React Components and Libraries with nwb](/docs/guides/ReactComponents.md#developing-react-components-and-libraries-with-nwb) for a more detailed guide.**

## npm Modules for the Web

```sh
nwb new web-module my-module

cd my-module/
```

`npm test` will run the project's tests and `npm run build` will create ES5, ES6 modules and UMD builds for publishing to npm.

## Why use nwb?

**Get started quickly**. Start developing from a single `.js` file or [generate a project skeleton](/docs/Commands.md#new).

**Covers the whole development cycle**. Development tools, testing and production builds for projects work out of the box, no configuration required.

**Flexible**. While everything works out of the box, you can also use an optional [configuration file](/docs/Configuration.md#configuration-file) to tweak things to your liking.

**Manages key development dependencies and configuration for you**. Check out an [example of the effect using nwb had](https://github.com/insin/react-yelp-clone/compare/master...nwb) on the amount of `devDependencies` and configuration to be managed in a real project it was dropped into.
