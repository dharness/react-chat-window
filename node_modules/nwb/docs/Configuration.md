## Configuration

nwb's default setup can get you developing, testing and building production-ready apps and npm-ready components out of the box without any configuration.

If you need to tweak the default setup to suit your project's needs, or you want to use some of the other features the Babel, Karma and Webpack ecosystems have to offer, you can provide a configuration file.

> You can also add new functionality by installing a [plugin module](/docs/Plugins.md#plugins).

### Configuration File

By default, nwb will look for an `nwb.config.js` file in the current working directory for configuration.

You can also specify a configuration file using the `--config` option:

```
nwb --config ./config/nwb.js
```

This file should export either a configuration object...

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
}
```

...or a function which returns a configuration object when called:

```js
module.exports = function(args) {
  return {
    // ...
  }
}
```

If a function is exported, it will be passed an object with the following properties:

- `args`: a parsed version of arguments passed to the `nwb` command
- `command`: the name of the command currently being executed, e.g. `'build'` or `'test'`
- `webpack`: nwb's version of the `webpack` module, giving you access to the other plugins webpack provides.

#### Example Configuration Files

- [react-hn's `nwb.config.js`](https://github.com/insin/react-hn/blob/concat/nwb.config.js) is a simple configuration file with minor tweaks to Babel and Webpack config.
- [React Yelp Clone's `nwb.config.js`](https://github.com/insin/react-yelp-clone/blob/nwb/nwb.config.js) configures Babel, Karma and Webpack to allow nwb to be dropped into an existing app to handle its development tooling, [reducing the amount of `devDependencies` and configuration](https://github.com/insin/react-yelp-clone/compare/master...nwb) which need to be managed.

    - [`package.json` fields](#packagejson-umd-banner-configuration)

#### `type`: `String` (required for generic build commands)

nwb uses this field to determine which type of project it's working with when generic build commands like `build` are used. If you're using commands which have the name of the type of project you're working with in them, you don't need to configure this.

If configured, it must be one of the following:

- `'inferno-app'`
- `'preact-app'`
- `'react-app'`
- `'react-component'`
- `'web-app'`
- `'web-module'`

#### `polyfill`: `Boolean`

For apps, nwb will provide polyfills for `Promise`, `fetch` and `Object.assign` by default.

To disable this, set `polyfill` to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  polyfill: false
}
```

### Babel Configuration

#### `babel`: `Object`

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) configuration can be provided in a `babel` object, using the following properties.

> For Webpack builds, any Babel config provided will be used to configure `babel-loader` - you can also provide additional configuration in [`webpack.rules`](#rules-object) if necessary.

##### `cherryPick`: `String | Array<String>`

Module names to apply `import` cherry-picking to.

> This feature only works if you're using `import` syntax.

If you import a module with destructuring, the entire module will normally be included in your build, even though you're only using specific pieces:

```js
import {This, That, TheOther} from 'some-module'
```

The usual workaround for this is to individually import submodules, which is tedious and bloats import sections in your code:

```js
import This from 'some-module/lib/This'
import That from 'some-module/lib/That'
import TheOther from 'some-module/lib/TheOther'
```

If you use `cherryPick` config, you can keep writing code like the first example, but transpile to the same code as the second, by specifying the module name(s) to apply a cherry-picking transform to:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    cherryPick: 'some-module'
  }
}
```

This is implemented using [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) - please check its issues for compatibility problems with modules you're using `cherryPick` with and report any new ones you find.

##### `loose`: `Boolean`

Some Babel plugins have a [loose mode](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/babel6-loose-mode.html) in which they output simpler, potentially faster code rather than following the semantics of the ES6 spec closely.

**nwb enables loose mode by default**.

If you want to disable loose mode (e.g. to check your code works in the stricter normal mode for forward-compatibility purposes), set it to `false`.

e.g. to disable loose mode only when running tests:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel {
    loose: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'
  }
}
```

##### `plugins`: `Array<String | Array>`

Additional Babel plugins to use.

nwb commands are run in the current working directory, so if you need to configure additional Babel plugins or presets, you can install them locally, pass their names and let Babel import them for you.

e.g. to install and use the [babel-plugin-react-html-attrs](https://github.com/insin/babel-plugin-react-html-attrs#readme) plugin:

```
npm install babel-plugin-react-html-attrs
```
```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    plugins: ['react-html-attrs']
  }
}
```

##### `presets`: `Array<String>`

Additional Babel presets to use.

##### `removePropTypes`: `Object | false`

Since React `propTypes` are only used in development mode, nwb removes them from React app production builds by default using the [react-remove-prop-types](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types) transform.

Set to `false` to disable use of this transform:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    removePropTypes: false,
  }
}
```

Provide an object to configure the [transform's options](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types#options):

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    removePropTypes: {
      // Remove imports of the 'prop-types' module as well
      // Only safe to enable if you're only using this module for propTypes
      removeImport: true
    },
  }
}
```

##### `reactConstantElements`: `false`

Set this to `false` to disable use of the [React constant element hoisting transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-constant-elements/) in React app production builds.

##### `runtime`: `String | Boolean`

Babel's [runtime transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-runtime/) does 3 things by default:

1. Imports helper modules from `babel-runtime` instead of duplicating **helpers** in every module which needs them.
2. Imports a local **polyfill** for new ES6 built-ins (`Promise`) and static methods (e.g. `Object.assign`) when they're used in your code.
3. Imports the **regenerator** runtime required to use `async`/`await` when needed.

nwb's default config turns the regenerator runtime import on so you can use `async`/`await` and generators.

To enable an additional feature, you can name it (either `'helpers'` or `'polyfill'`):

```js
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    runtime: 'helpers'
  }
}
```

To enable all features, set `runtime` to `true`.

To disable use of the runtime transform, set `runtime` to `false`.

> **Note:** if you use `async`/`await` or enable the runtime transform's other features in a React Component or Web Module project, you will need to add `babel-runtime` to your package.json `peerDependencies` to ensure it can be resolved when somebody else uses your module from npm.

##### `stage`: `Number | false`

> nwb implements its own equivalent of Babel 5's `stage` config for Babel 6

Controls which Babel preset will be used to enable use of experimental, proposed and upcoming JavaScript features in your code, grouped by the stage they're at in the TC39 process for proposing new JavaScript features:

| Stage | TC39 Category | Features |
| ----- | ------------- | -------- |
| [0](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0) | Strawman, just an idea |`do {...}` expressions, `::` function bind operator |
| [1](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1) | Proposal: this is worth working on | export extensions |
| [2](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-2) | Draft: initial spec | class properties, `@decorator` syntax (using the [Babel Legacy Decorator plugin](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy)) - **enabled by default** |
| [3](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-3) | Candidate: complete spec and initial browser implementations | object rest/spread `...` syntax,  `async`/`await`, `**` exponentiation operator, trailing function commas |

e.g. if you want to use export extensions in your app, you should set `stage` to `1`:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel {
    stage: 1
  }
}
```

Stage 2 is enabled by default - to disable use of a stage preset entirely, set `stage` to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  babel {
    stage: false
  }
}
```

### Webpack Configuration

#### `webpack`: `Object`

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration can be provided in a `webpack` object, using the following properties:

##### `aliases`: `Object`

Configures [Webpack aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias), which allow you to control module resolution. Typically aliases are used to make it easier to import certain modules from within nested directories in an app.

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    aliases: {
      // Enable use of 'img/file.png' paths in JavaScript and
      // "~images/file.png" paths in stylesheets to require an image from
      // src/images from anywhere in the the app.
      'img': path.resolve('src/images'),
      // Enable use of require('src/path/to/module.js') for top-down imports
      // from anywhere in the app, to promote writing location-independent
      // code by avoiding ../ directory traversal.
      'src': path.resolve('src')
    }
  }
}
```

You should be careful to avoid creating aliases which conflict with the names of Node.js built-ins or npm packages, as you will then be unable to import them.

##### `autoprefixer`: `String | Object`

Configures [Autoprefixer options](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#options) for nwb's default PostCSS configuration.

If you just need to configure the range of browsers prefix addition/removal is based on (nwb's default is `>1%, last 4 versions, Firefox ESR, not ie < 9`), you can use a String:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    autoprefixer: '> 1%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, ios >= 8'
  }
}
```

Use an Object if you need to set any of Autoprefixer's other options.

e.g. if you also want to disable removal of prefixes which aren't required for the configured range of browsers:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    autoprefixer: {
      remove: false,
    }
  }
}
```

You can check which browsers your Autoprefixer configuration will target using the [browserl.ist](http://browserl.ist) service.

##### `compat`: `Object`

Certain libraries require specific configuration to play nicely with Webpack - nwb can take care of the details for you if you use a `compat` object to tell it when you're using them.

The following libraries are supported:

###### `enzyme`: `Boolean`

Set to `true` for [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) compatibility - this assumes you're using the latest version of React (v15).

###### `intl`: `Object`

If you use [intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intl) in a Webpack build, all the locales it supports will be imported by default and your build will be larger than you were expecting!

Provide an object with a `locales` Array specifying language codes for the locales you want to load.

###### `moment`: `Object`

If you use [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) in a Webpack build, all the locales it supports will be imported by default and your build will be about 139KB larger than you were expecting!

Provide an object with a `locales` Array specifying language codes for the locales you want to load.

###### `react-intl`: `Object`

If you use [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) in a Webpack build, all the locales it supports will be imported by default and your build will be larger than you were expecting!

Provide an object with a `locales` Array specifying language codes for the locales you want to load.

###### `sinon`: `Boolean`

Set to `true` for [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) 1.x compatibility.

---

Example config showing the use of multiple `compat` settings:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    compat: {
      enzyme: true,
      moment: {
        locales: ['de', 'en-gb', 'es', 'fr', 'it']
      },
      sinon: true
    }
  }
}
```

##### `define`: `Object`

By default, nwb will use Webpack's [`DefinePlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/) to replace all occurrences of `process.env.NODE_ENV` with a string containing `NODE_ENV`'s current value.

You can configure a `define` object to add your own constant values.

e.g. to replace all occurrences of `__VERSION__` with a string containing your app's version from its `package.json`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    define: {
      __VERSION__: JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').version)
    }
  }
}
```

##### `extractText`: `Object`

Configures [options for `ExtractTextWebpackPlugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin#readme).

##### `html`: `Object`

Configures [options for `HtmlWebpackPlugin`](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin#readme).

For apps, nwb will look for a `src/index.html` template to inject `<link>` and `<script>` tags into for CSS and JavaScript bundles generated by Webpack.

Use `template`config if you have an HTML file elsewhere you want to use:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    html: {
      template: 'html/index.html'
    }
  }
}
```

If you don't have a template at `src/index.html` or specify one via `template`, nwb will fall back to using a basic template which has the following properties you can configure:

- `title` - contents for `<title>`

  > Default: the value of `name` from your app's `package.json`

- `mountId` - the `id` for the `<div>` provided for your app to mount itself into

  > Default: `'app'`

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    html: {
      mountId: 'root',
      title: 'Unimaginative documentation example'
    }
  }
}
```

Other `HtmlWebpackPlugin` options can also be used. e.g. if you have a `favicon.ico` in your `src/` directory, you can include it in the `index.html` generated when your app is built and have it copied to the output directory like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    html: {
      favicon: 'src/favicon.ico'
    }
  }
}
```

##### `install`: `Object`

Configures [options for `NpmInstallPlugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/npm-install-webpack-plugin#usage), which will be used if you pass an `--install` flag to nwb commands which run a development server.

##### `rules`: `Object`

Each [Webpack rule](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#module-rules) generated by nwb has a unique id you can use to customise it:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    rules: {
      // Inline GIFs and PNGs smaller than 10KB
      graphics: {
        limit: 10000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rule configuration objects can contain rule options such as `include` and `exclude` (which control which files the rule applies to) and options for the rule's loader (which control what happens to the resource).

Loader options can be provided directly in the configuration object, as shown above, or you can use a nested `options` object.

Refer to the documentation of the Webpack loader used in each rule (linked to in [default rules](#default-rules) below) for options which can be configured.

###### Default Rules

Default rules generated by nwb and their associated ids are:

- `babel` - handles `.js` files with [babel-loader][babel-loader]

  > Default config: `{exclude: /node_modules/, options: {babelrc: false, cacheDirectory: true}}`

- `graphics` - handles `.gif`, `.png` and `.webp` files using using [url-loader][url-loader]

- `svg` - handles `.svg` files using using [url-loader][url-loader]

- `jpeg` - handles `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files using [url-loader][url-loader]

- `fonts` - handles `.eot`, `.otf`, `.ttf`, `.woff` and `.woff2` files using [url-loader][url-loader]

- `video` - handles `.mp4`, `.ogg` and `.webm` files using [url-loader][url-loader]

- `audio` - handles `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, and `.oga` files using [url-loader][url-loader]

> Default config for all url-loaders is `{options: {limit: 1, name: '[name].[hash:8].[ext]'}}`.
>
> Default `limit` config prevents any files being inlined by default, while allowing you to configure `url-loader` to enable inlining if you need it.

See the [Stylesheets documentation](/docs/Stylesheets.md#) for default rules generated for stylesheets.

###### Customising loaders

Provide `loader` config for a rule to replace its loader:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    rules: {
      svg: {
        loader: 'svg-inline-loader',
        options: {classPrefix: true}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To chain loaders, provide `use` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    rules: {
      svg: {
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'svg-inline-loader',
            options: {classPrefix: true}
          },
          'image-webpack-loader'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

###### Disabling default rules

To disable a default rule, set its id to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    rules: {
      svg: false
    }
  }
}
```

##### `publicPath`: `String`

> This is just Webpack's [`output.publicPath` config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-publicpath) pulled up a level to make it more convenient to configure.

`publicPath` defines the URL static resources will be referenced by in build output, such as `<link>` and `<src>` tags in generated HTML, `url()` in stylesheets and paths to any static resources you `require()` into your modules.

The default `publicPath` configured for most app builds is `/`, which assumes you will be serving your app's static resources from the root of whatever URL it's hosted at:

```html
<script src="/app.12345678.js"></script>
```

If you're serving static resources from a different path, or from an external URL such as a CDN, set it as the `publicPath`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    publicPath: 'https://cdn.example.com/myapp/'
  }
}
```

The exception is the React component demo app, which doesn't set a `publicPath`, generating a build without any root URL paths to static resources. This allows you to serve it at any path without configuration (e.g. on GitHub Project Pages), or open the generated `index.html` file directly in a browser, which is ideal for distributing app builds which don't require a server to run.

If you want to create a path-independent build, set `publicPath` to blank or `null`:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    publicPath: ''
  }
}
```

The trade-off for path-independence is HTML5 History routing won't work, as serving up `index.html` at anything but its real path will mean its static resource URLs won't resolve. You will have to fall back on hash-based routing if you need it.

##### `styles`: `Object | false | 'old'`

Configures how nwb creates Webpack config for importing stylesheets.

See the [Stylesheets documentation](/docs/Stylesheets.md#stylesheets) for details.

##### `uglify`: `Object | false`

Configures [options for Webpack's `UglifyJsPlugin`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin), which will be used when creating production builds.

Any additional options provided will be merged into nwb's defaults, which are:

```js
{
  compress: {
    warnings: false
  },
  output: {
    comments: false
  },
  sourceMap: true
}
```

For example, if you want to strip development-only code but keep the output readable for debugging:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    uglify: {
      mangle: false,
      beautify: true
    }
  }
}
```

To completely disable use of UglifyJS, set `uglify` to false:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    uglify: false
  }
}
```

##### `extra`: `Object`

Extra configuration to be merged into the generated Webpack configuration using [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#webpack-merge---merge-designed-for-webpack) - see the [Webpack configuration docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) for the available properties.

> **Note:** Webpack 2 validates the structure of the config it's given, so providing invalid or unexpected config will break the build.

e.g. to add an extra rule which isn't managed by nwb's own `webpack.rules` config, you would need to provide a list of rules at `webpack.extra.module.rules`.

```js
var path = require('path')

module.exports = function(nwb) {
  return {
    type: 'react-app',
    webpack: {
      extra: {
        // Example of adding an extra rule which isn't managed by nwb,
        // assuming you have installed html-loader in your project.
        module: {
          rules: [
            {test: /\.html$/, loader: 'html-loader'}
          ]
        },
        // Example of adding an extra plugin which isn't managed by nwb
        plugins: [
          new nwb.webpack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({
            minChunkSize: 1024
          })
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### `config`: `Function`

Finally, if you need *complete* control, provide a `webpack.config()` function which will be given the generated config.

> **Note:** you *must* return a config object from this function.

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    config(config) {
      // Change config as you wish

      // You MUST return the edited config object
      return config
    }
  }
}
```

### Dev Server Configuration

nwb uses [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server#readme) to serve apps for development - you can tweak the options nwb uses and also enable additional features.

#### `devServer`: `Object`

Configuration for Webpack Dev Server - see Webpack's [`devServer` config documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver) for the available options.

Any `devServer` options provided will be merged on top of the following default options nwb uses:

```js
{
  historyApiFallback: true,
  hot: true,
  noInfo: true,
  overlay: true,
  publicPath: webpackConfig.output.publicPath,
  quiet: true,
  watchOptions: {
    ignored: /node_modules/,
  },
}
```

Notable features you can configure using these options:

- [`devServer.historyApiFallback`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-historyapifallback) - configure `disableDotRule` if you need to use dots in your path when using the HTML5 History API.

- [`devServer.https`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-https) - enable HTTPS with a default self-signed certificate, or provide your own certificates.

- [`devServer.overlay`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-overlay) - disable the compile error overlay, or have it also appear for warnings.

- [`devServer.proxy`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-proxy) - proxy certain URLs to a separate API backend development server.

- [`devServer.setup`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-setup) - access the Express app to add your own middleware to the dev server.

e.g. to enable HTTPS:

```js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    https: true
  }
}
```

### Karma Configuration

nwb's default [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) configuration uses the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework and reporter plugins for it, but you can configure your own preferences.

> **Note:** At runtime, Karma sets a `usePolling` autoWatch option to `true` [if the platform is detected to be macOS or Linux](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/lib/config.js#L318). However, Karma's non-polling file-watching works correctly and consumes dramatically less CPU on macOS. nwb users on macOS will want to set `usePolling: false` within the [`extra:`](#extra-object-1) Object in the `karma:` config section of their `nwb.config.js`.

#### `karma`: `Object`

Karma configuration can be provided in a `karma` object, using the following properties:

##### `browsers`: `Array<String | Plugin>`

> Default: `['PhantomJS']`

A list of browsers to run tests in.

PhantomJS is the default as it's installed by default with nwb and should be able to run in any environment.

The launcher plugin for Chrome is also included, so if you want to run tests in Chrome, you can just name it:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    browsers: ['Chrome']
  }
}
```

For other browsers, you will also need to supply a plugin and manage that dependency yourself:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    browsers: ['Firefox'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-firefox-launcher')
    ]
  }
}
```

nwb can also use the first browser defined in a launcher plugin if you pass it in `browsers`:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    browsers: [
      'Chrome',
      require('karma-firefox-launcher')
    ]
  }
}
```

##### `excludeFromCoverage`: `String | Array<String>`

> Default: `['test/', 'tests/', 'src/**/__tests__/']`

Globs for paths which should be excluded from code coverage reporting.

##### `frameworks`: `Array<String | Plugin>`

> Default: `['mocha']`

Karma testing framework plugins.

You must provide the plugin for any custom framework you want to use and manage it as a dependency yourself.

e.g. if you're using a testing framework which produces [TAP](https://testanything.org/) output (such as [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)). this is how you would use `frameworks` and `plugins` props to configure Karma:

```
npm install --save-dev karma-tap
```
```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: ['tap'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-tap')
    ]
  }
}
```

nwb can also determine the correct framework name given the plugin itself, so the following is functionally identical to the configuration above:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: [
      require('karma-tap')
    ]
  }
}
```

If a plugin module provides multiple plugins, nwb will only infer the name of the first plugin it provides, so pass it using `plugins` instead and list all the frameworks you want to use, for clarity:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    frameworks: ['mocha', 'chai', 'chai-as-promised'],
    plugins: [
      require('karma-chai-plugins') // Provides chai, chai-as-promised, ...
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If you're configuring frameworks and you want to use the Mocha framework plugin managed by nwb, just pass its name as in the above example.

##### `testContext`: `String`

Use this configuration to point to a [Webpack context module](/docs/Testing.md#using-a-test-context-module) for your tests if you need to run code prior to any tests being run, such as customising the assertion library you're using, or global before and after hooks.

If you provide a context module, it is responsible for including tests via Webpack's  `require.context()` - see the [example in the Testing docs](/docs/Testing.md#using-a-test-context-module).

If the default [`testFiles`](#testfiles-string--arraystring) config wouldn't have picked up your tests, you must also configure it so they can be excluded from code coverage.

##### `testFiles`: `String | Array<String>`

> Default: `.spec.js`, `.test.js` or `-test.js` files anywhere under `src/`, `test/` or `tests/`

[Minimatch glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for test files.

If [`karma.testContext`](#testcontext-string) is not being used, this controls which files Karma will run tests from.

This can also be used to exclude tests from code coverage if you're using [`karma.testContext`](#testcontext-string) - if the default `testFiles` patterns wouldn't have picked up your tests, configure this as well to exclude then from code coverage.

##### `plugins`: `Array<Plugin>`

A list of plugins to be loaded by Karma - this should be used in combination with [`browsers`](#browsers-arraystring--plugin), [`frameworks`](#frameworks-arraystring--plugin) and [`reporters`](#reporters-arraystring--plugin) config as necessary.

##### `reporters`: `Array<String | Plugin>`

> Default: `['mocha']`

Customising reporters follows the same principle as frameworks, just using the `reporters` prop instead.

For built-in reporters, or nwb's version of the Mocha reporter, just pass a name:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    reporters: ['progress']
  }
}
```

For custom reporters, install and provide the plugin:

```
npm install --save-dev karma-tape-reporter
```
```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    reporters: [
      require('karma-tape-reporter')
    ]
  }
}
```

##### `extra`: `Object`

Extra configuration to be merged into the generated Karma configuration using [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#webpack-merge---merge-designed-for-webpack).

> **Note:** you *must* use Karma's own config structure in this object.

e.g. to tweak the configuration of the default Mocha reporter:

```js
module.exports = {
  karma: {
    extra: {
      mochaReporter: {
        divider: '°º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸,ø¤°º¤ø,¸¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸',
        output: 'autowatch'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### npm Build Configuration

By default, nwb creates ES5 and ES6 modules builds for publishing to npm.

#### `npm`: `Object`

npm build configuration is defined in a `npm` object, using the following fields:

##### `cjs`: `Boolean`

> Defaults to `true` if not provided.

Determines whether or not nwb will create a CommonJS build in `lib/` when you run `nwb build` for a React component/library or web module project.

Set to `false` to disable this:

```js
module.exports = {
  npm: {
    cjs: false
  }
}
```

##### `esModules`: `Boolean`

> Defaults to `true` if not provided.

Determines whether or not nwb will create an ES6 modules build for use by ES6 module bundlers when you run `nwb build` for a React component/library or web module project.

When providing an ES6 modules build, you should also provide the following in `package.json` so compatible module bundlers can find it:

```
"module": "es/index.js",
```

These are included automatically if you create a project with an ES6 modules build enabled.

##### `umd`: `String | Object`

Configures creation of a UMD build when you run `nwb build` for a React component/library or web module.

If you just need to configure the global variable the UMD build will export, you can use a String:

```js
module.exports = {
  npm: {
    umd: 'MyLibrary'
  }
}
```

If you also have some external dependencies to configure, use an object containing the following properties:

###### `global`: `String`

The name of the global variable the UMD build will export.

###### `externals`: `Object`

A mapping from `peerDependency` module names to the global variables they're expected to be available as for use by the UMD build.

e.g. if you're creating a React component which also depends on [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), this configuration would ensure they're not included in the UMD build:

```js
module.exports = {
  npm: {
    umd: {
      global: 'MyComponent',
      externals: {
        'react': 'React',
        'react-router': 'ReactRouter'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `package.json` UMD Banner Configuration

A banner comment added to UMD builds will use as many of the following `package.json` fields as are present:

- `name`
- `version`
- `homepage`
- `license`

If all fields are present the banner will be in this format:

```js
/*!
 * your-project v1.2.3 - https://github.com/you/your-project
 * MIT Licensed
 */
```
